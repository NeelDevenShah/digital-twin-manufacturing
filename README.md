## AI Algorithms

DigiManuf incorporates advanced machine learning models for:

- Anomaly Detection: Detects irregularities in machine performance and operations to prevent costly downtime.
- Predictive Maintenance: Uses historical data and real-time inputs to predict equipment failures and optimize maintenance schedules, reducing unplanned downtime.

## How It Works

1. Data Collection: IoT sensors collect real-time data from machines and operations.
2. Data Processing: Cloud-based systems process the incoming data streams.
3. Digital Twin Update: The virtual replica of the manufacturing operations is updated in real-time based on processed data.
4. AI Analysis: Machine learning models analyze patterns and provide insights into potential issues, performance metrics, and predictive analytics.
5. Control Implementation: The system sends actionable insights to operators, allowing for adjustments in physical operations.
6. Continuous Learning: The AI models continuously evolve as more data is collected.
